# Grip-Task2
Task-2:- For the iris dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually

The iris dataset consists of sepal (length and width), petal (length and width) columns.
The task is to based on these columns we have to partition the dataset into the optimum number of clusters.
In fact, there are 3 species of iris flower i.e Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica.
Hence, using K-Means Clustering, the visualization is done in this task.
